Clothing Retail Analytics Project üõçÔ∏èüí∞
Empowering a small clothing retail business to save money, save time, and increase income through data-driven insights.

üìñ Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset for a small clothing retail business to optimize operations and boost profitability. By leveraging data from six tables (Customers, Products, Sales, Inventory_Restock, Employees, Marketing), we uncover insights to:

Save Money: Identify unprofitable sales, overstocked inventory, and low-ROI marketing campaigns.
Save Time: Optimize restocking and employee scheduling.
Increase Income: Focus on high-selling products, peak sales days, and effective marketing channels.

Key analyses include:

Top 10 Products Sold: Identify best-selling products to prioritize inventory and promotions.
Sales by Day of the Week: Detect peak sales days (e.g., weekends) for staffing and marketing.
Marketing Channel ROI: Evaluate campaign performance to allocate budget efficiently.
Loss Identification: Pinpoint unprofitable sales, overstocking, returns, and low-performing employees or customers.

üöÄ Getting Started
Prerequisites

Python 3.8+
Libraries: Install required packages:pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn


Chart.js: For web-based visualizations, include Chart.js via CDN (no installation needed).
CSV Files: Ensure the six CSV files are in the project directory (e.g., ./data/).

Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/clothing-retail-analytics.git
cd clothing-retail-analytics


Place CSV Files:
Copy the dataset CSV files into a data/ folder in the project root.
Update file paths in scripts if your files are stored elsewhere.


Run the Code:
Use Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or a Python IDE.
Execute scripts in the scripts/ folder (see below).



üõ†Ô∏è Code Structure
The repository includes Python scripts for data analysis and visualization:

top_products.py: Identifies the top 10 products by units sold and visualizes with Seaborn and Chart.js.
sales_by_day.py: Analyzes sales by day of the week to identify peak days.
marketing_roi.py: Calculates average ROI by marketing channel to optimize budget allocation.
loss_analysis.py: Detects losses from unprofitable sales, overstocking, returns, low-performing employees, and customers.

Each script includes:

Data loading and preprocessing with pandas.
Seaborn visualizations for immediate rendering.
Chart.js configurations for web-based charts (save as HTML).

üìà Visualizations
Visualizations help identify opportunities and losses. Below are key analyses with sample outputs.
1. Top 10 Products Sold
Purpose: Prioritize high-selling products for inventory and promotions.Output: Bar chart showing total units sold by product, colored by category.Seaborn Example:
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.barplot(x='Total_Units_Sold', y='Product_Name', hue='Category', data=top_10_products, palette='Set2')
plt.title('Top 10 Products by Units Sold')
plt.show()

Chart.js Example: Save as HTML and open in a browser:
<canvas id="myChart"></canvas>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js"></script>
<script>
  const ctx = document.getElementById('myChart').getContext('2d');
  new Chart(ctx, { /* Chart.js config from top_products.py */ });
</script>

2. Sales by Day of the Week
Purpose: Identify peak sales days (e.g., weekends) for staffing and promotions.Output: Bar chart of total sales (CHF) by day.Seaborn Example:
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.barplot(x='Day_of_Week', y='Total_Sales_CHF', data=sales_by_day, palette='Set2')
plt.title('Sales by Day of the Week')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()

3. Marketing Channel ROI
Purpose: Optimize marketing budget by focusing on high-ROI channels.Output: Bar chart of average ROI by channel (e.g., Instagram, LocalFlyer).Seaborn Example:
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
sns.barplot(x='ROI', y='Channel', data=avg_roi, palette='crest')
plt.title('Average ROI by Marketing Channel')
plt.show()

4. Loss Analysis
Purpose: Identify unprofitable products, overstocking, and low-ROI campaigns.Output: Bar charts for unprofitable products, overstocked items, and low-ROI channels.Seaborn Example (Unprofitable Products):
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.barplot(x='Profit_CHF', y='Product_Name', data=unprofitable_by_product, palette='Reds_r')
plt.title('Top 10 Unprofitable Products by Total Profit')
plt.show()

üí° Usage and Insights
Key Findings

Top Products: Jeans and Dresses are top sellers, suggesting a focus on these categories for promotions.
Sales Peaks: Saturday and Sunday drive the most sales, indicating higher staffing needs on weekends.
Marketing Efficiency: Instagram and LocalFlyer campaigns yield the highest ROI; reallocate budget from low-ROI channels like Facebook.
Losses:
Unprofitable Sales: High discounts or returns on certain products (e.g., Shoes) reduce margins.
Overstocking: Products like Shoes 50 have high stock-to-sales ratios, tying up capital.
Returns: Online channel has higher return rates, suggesting improved product descriptions.



Business Actions

Save Money: Reduce discounts on low-margin products, liquidate overstocked items, and cut low-ROI campaigns.
Save Time: Optimize restocking with faster suppliers and schedule staff for peak days.
